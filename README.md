# Ruby vs. Crystal

These are two simple scripts to test Ruby and Crystal.

My results below using the `time` command.

`crystal test.cr  0.78s user 0.29s system 119% cpu 0.896 total`

`ruby test.rb  0.88s user 4.71s system 376% cpu 1.483 total`

Ruby script is printing "Hello" 10,000 times and the Crystal script is printing "Hello" 100,000 times.
